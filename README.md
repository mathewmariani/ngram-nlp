# Natural Language Processing

Automatic Language Identification using n-gram based models.


### n-gram

In its current version the n-gram models are based directly on ASCII characters; all invalid characters will be ignored.

### Training Corpus

The training corpus used was incredibly small. In this case I used 200 sentences or about 16 kilobytes of text for each language (English, French) which will not yield accurate results.
